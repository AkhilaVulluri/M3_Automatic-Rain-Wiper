The turn of the century has seen a tremendous rise in technological advances in the field of automobiles. With 5G
technology on its way and the development in the IoT sector, cars will start interacting with each other using V2V
communications and become much more autonomous. In
this project, an effort is made to move in the same direction
by proposing a model for an automatic car wiper system
that operates on sensing rain and snow on the windshield
of a car. We develop a prototype for our idea by integrating a servo motor and raindrop sensor with an AT89C51
Microcontroller.

Todayâ€™s car wipers are manual systems that work on the
principle of manual switching. So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on
detecting rain and stops when the rain stops. Our project
brings forward this system to automate the wiper system
not need manual intervention. For this purpose, we use a
rain sensor along with a microcontroller to drive the wiper
motor. Our system uses a rain sensor to detect rain, this
signal is then processed by a microcontroller to take the
desired action. The rain sensor works on the principle of
using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls
on it, the circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to
the microcontroller. The microcontroller now processes this
data and controls the motor. This system is equally useful
for Aircraft and a smaller version of this can be used by
motorbikers in their helmets so that they can drive easily in
rains. Figure 1 shows the block diagram for our proposed
idea.

In the current scenario, only high-end vehicles employ intelligent rain-sensing automatic wiper systems. Our system is
modeled to demonstrate how useful is an automatic wiper
system that adjusts speed itself based on rainfall intensity.
Such a system improves the safety of a ride. There are many
instances of accidents occurring during heavy rainfall due to
lack of proper vision. In many cases, these accidents were
due to manual errors (for example: not increasing the speed
of the wiper) from the driver. An automatic, intelligent
system like ours removes any manual errors. Our system
adjusts wiper speed according to the intensity of rainfall and
hence improves safety. Nowadays some models of Ford and
Hyundai are also implementing an automatic wiper system
in their vehicles
